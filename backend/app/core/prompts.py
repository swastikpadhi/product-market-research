Centralized Prompt Templates for Market Research Agents

All LLM prompts are defined here for easy auditing, versioning, and improvement.
Update these templates to refine agent behavior without changing code logic.

Version: 1.0.0
Last Updated: 2025-10-04

ARCHITECTURE:
============

1. COMMON GUARDRAILS
   Applied to DATA ANALYSIS agents (7 guardrails):
   - Grounding rules (prevent fabrication)
   - Quality standards (specific, quantitative)
   - Product focus (avoid generic insights)
   - Citation tracking (source every claim)
   - Information security (protect PII, credentials, sensitive data)
   - Output format (valid JSON)
   - JSON validation (required fields)

   Applied to INPUT PROCESSING agents (4 guardrails):
   - Information security (protect PII, credentials, sensitive data)
   - Product focus (ensure product-specific queries)
   - Output format (valid JSON)
   - JSON validation (required fields)

2. AGENT-SPECIFIC PROMPTS
   Each agent has custom instructions + schema:
   - Orchestrator: Parse product idea & generate 3 search queries (INPUT PROCESSING)
   - Market Analyzer: Analyze market trends, growth, opportunities (DATA ANALYSIS)
   - Competitor Analyzer: Analyze competitors, pricing, gaps (DATA ANALYSIS)
   - Customer Insights: Analyze pain points, needs, sentiment (DATA ANALYSIS)
   - Report Generator: Synthesize all data into final report (DATA ANALYSIS)

3. CITATION FLOW
   Hybrid approach for accuracy:
   - Data analysis agents track citations as they analyze (claim + url + title)
   - Report Generator aggregates & deduplicates citations
   - Final report has 10-20 verified sources

OPENAI CALL OPTIMIZATION:
========================
Total: 5 calls per research task
  1. Orchestrator: Parse product idea + generate 3 queries (consolidated)
  2. Market Analyzer: Analyze data + generate citations
  3. Competitor Analyzer: Analyze data + generate citations
  4. Customer Insights: Analyze data + generate citations
  5. Report Generator: Synthesize + aggregate citations

STANDARD REPORT SCHEMA:
======================
All reports follow this structure:
- executive_summary: Overview, key findings, confidence
- market_insights: Size, growth, trends, drivers
- competitive_landscape: Leaders, competitors, gaps, pricing
- customer_insights: Pain points, needs, segments, priorities
- pmf_assessment: Fit score, opportunities, risks, timeline
- strategic_recommendations: Actions, development, entry, metrics
- citations: Source attributions (claim, url, title, source_type)
"""

# COMMON GUARDRAILS
# =============================================================================

COMMON_OUTPUT_FORMAT = """
OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:
- Return ONLY valid JSON
- No markdown code blocks (```json```)
- No text before or after the JSON object
- All JSON keys must use double quotes
- Escape special characters properly
"""

COMMON_GROUNDING_RULES = """
GROUNDING RULES (CRITICAL):
1. Base ALL analysis on the provided data sources
2. DO NOT fabricate statistics, company names, or data points
3. If data is insufficient, state "Data unavailable" rather than guessing
4. Cite specific data points from the provided sources
5. Distinguish between facts (from sources) and inferences (your analysis)
6. Use phrases like "Based on the data..." or "Sources indicate..."
"""

COMMON_QUALITY_STANDARDS = """
QUALITY STANDARDS:
- Be specific and actionable (avoid generic advice)
- Include quantitative data when available (numbers, percentages, dollar amounts)
- Provide context for all claims (timeframes, geographic scope, market segments)
- Use clear, professional business language
- Prioritize recent and relevant information
"""

COMMON_PRODUCT_FOCUS = """
PRODUCT-SPECIFIC FOCUS:
- ALL analysis must be specific to the given product idea
- Avoid generic sector-level insights unless they benefit THIS specific product
- Connect every insight to how it impacts THIS specific product
- Consider the unique value proposition of THIS product
- Think about the specific customer problem THIS product solves
"""

COMMON_JSON_VALIDATION = """
JSON VALIDATION:
- Ensure all required fields are present
- Use empty arrays [] for missing list data
- Use "N/A" or "Data unavailable" for missing string data
- Never use null values
- Arrays should contain 2-5 items when data is available
- All text fields should be substantive (minimum 20 words for descriptions)
"""

COMMON_CITATION_TRACKING = """
CITATION TRACKING (CRITICAL):
- For EVERY major claim, statistic, or data point, record its source
- Create a citation entry with:
  * claim: The specific data point or insight
  * url: The source URL where you found this information
  * title: The document/page title (extract from content if available)
- If you reference data from a source, it MUST have a citation
- Better to have too many citations than too few
- This ensures all claims are verifiable and traceable
"""

COMMON_INFOSEC_GUARDRAILS = """
INFORMATION SECURITY (CRITICAL):
1. DO NOT include any personally identifiable information (PII) in your output
2. DO NOT include email addresses, phone numbers, physical addresses, or names of individuals
3. DO NOT include API keys, credentials, tokens, or any authentication data
4. DO NOT include internal company information, trade secrets, or confidential data
5. If source material contains PII, redact it as [REDACTED] in your analysis
6. Only reference publicly available information from the provided sources
7. Company names and publicly traded entities are acceptable
8. Market data, statistics, and publicly available business information are acceptable
9. When in doubt about data sensitivity, err on the side of caution and omit it
10. Focus on aggregate data, trends, and public market information

Create a comprehensive Product-Market Fit research report for {sector}{product_context}.

SYNTHESIS APPROACH:
- Integrate insights from all three analysis streams (market, competitor, customer)
- Identify patterns and connections across data sources
- Prioritize product-specific insights over general industry information
- Ensure all recommendations are backed by data from the provided sources

CITATION AGGREGATION:
- Collect all citations from the three agent analyses (market, competitor, customer)
- Deduplicate citations by URL (keep the most comprehensive entry per URL)
- Group by source_type: market_analysis, competitor_analysis, customer_insights
- Consolidate insights from multiple citations per source if needed
- Add source_type field to each citation based on which agent provided it
- Final output should have 10-20 citations covering all key findings
- Maintain the claim/url/title structure from agent citations

SCHEMA REQUIREMENTS:
- All top-level keys are REQUIRED
- If data is unavailable: use empty arrays [] for lists, "N/A" for strings
- Arrays should contain 3-5 items when data is available
- Pain points must include: issue, frequency (High/Medium/Low), impact (High/Medium/Low)
- Product fit score must include percentage and brief explanation
- All recommendations must be specific, actionable, and data-driven
- Confidence level must be: "High" (5+ quality sources), "Medium" (3-4 sources), "Low" (1-2 sources or limited data)
- Product fit score must be realistic: "90-100%" (proven market, clear demand), "70-89%" (growing market, strong signals), "50-69%" (emerging market, moderate demand), "30-49%" (niche market, limited demand), "10-29%" (experimental, high risk), "0-9%" (futuristic, very high risk)
- Success probability must reflect market reality: "Very High" (90%+), "High" (70-89%), "Medium" (50-69%), "Low" (30-49%), "Very Low" (10-29%), "Extremely Low" (0-9%)

PRODUCT-MARKET FIT EVALUATION CRITERIA:
- Assess market readiness: Is the market mature enough for this product?
- Evaluate demand signals: Are there clear customer pain points this solves?
- Consider competitive landscape: How crowded is the market?
- Analyze feasibility: Is the technology/regulatory environment ready?
- Factor in timing: Is this the right time for this product?

PMF SCORE GUIDELINES:
- 90-100%: Proven market with clear demand (e.g., established SaaS tools)
- 70-89%: Growing market with strong signals (e.g., AI productivity tools)
- 50-69%: Emerging market with moderate demand (e.g., AR/VR applications)
- 30-49%: Niche market with limited demand (e.g., specialized B2B tools)
- 10-29%: Experimental with high risk (e.g., quantum computing apps)
- 0-9%: Futuristic with very high risk (e.g., space tourism apps)

REPORT STRUCTURE:
1. Executive Summary - Key findings and recommendations
2. Market Insights - Size, growth, trends, opportunities
3. Competitive Landscape - Key players, positioning, gaps
4. Customer Insights - Pain points, needs, satisfaction
5. Product-Market Fit Assessment - Opportunities and risks
6. Strategic Recommendations - Actionable next steps
7. Citations - Source references with URLs and key insights
